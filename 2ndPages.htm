          <h1>Road Bike</h1>
          <h2>
            Road bikes are lightweight and 
            designed for speed on paved roads. 
            They have narrow tires and drop 
            handlebars that allow the rider to 
            lean forward in an aerodynamic position. 
            Road bikes are great for long-distance 
            riding, racing, and smooth surfaces. 
            They are ideal for commuting in cities 
            or doing long endurance rides.

          <h1>Mountain Bike/MTB</h1>
          <h2>
            Mountain bikes are built for rugged, 
            off-road terrains like dirt paths, rocky 
            trails, and steep hills. They come with 
            wide, knobby tires for better traction 
            and typically feature suspension systems 
            (either front suspension or full suspension) 
            to absorb shocks. Mountain bikes are perfect 
            for adventure seekers and those who love 
            trail riding in nature.

          <h1>Hybrid Bike</h1>
          <h2>
            Hybrid bikes combine features from both road 
            and mountain bikes, making them versatile 
            for multiple surfaces. They are ideal for 
            casual riders and commuters who may encounter 
            both paved roads and light off-road trails. 
            Hybrids usually have flat handlebars for an 
            upright position and medium-width tires, 
            offering a balance between speed and comfort.

          <h1>Gravel Bike</h1>
          <h2>
            Gravel bikes are designed for long rides on 
            mixed terrain, such as gravel roads, 
            dirt tracks, and some pavement. They look 
            similar to road bikes but have wider tires 
            for better traction on rough surfaces. These 
            bikes are popular for adventure riding, 
            bikepacking, and cycling on less-maintained roads.

          <h1>Cruiser Bike</h1>
          <h2>
            Cruiser bikes are all about comfort and 
            style. They feature wide, balloon-style tires, 
            a relaxed, upright riding position, and large, 
            comfortable seats. Cruisers are perfect for 
            flat terrain, such as beach towns or urban areas, 
            where speed is not a priority. They are often 
            chosen for leisure riding and short, slow-paced 
            trips.

          <h1>BMX Bike</h1>
          <h2>
            BMX (Bicycle Motocross) bikes are small, durable 
            bikes designed for tricks, stunts, and racing. 
            They are used in skate parks or for dirt racing on 
            short tracks. BMX bikes have a single gear and 
            strong frames to withstand the impact of jumps and 
            tricks. Their compact size also makes them highly 
            maneuverable.

          <h1>Folding Bike</h1>
          <h2>
            Folding bikes are compact and can be folded into 
            a smaller size, making them convenient for city 
            commuters who need to take their bike on public 
            transportation or store it in small spaces. Despite 
            their smaller frame and wheels, many folding bikes 
            still offer good speed and comfort for urban riding. 
            They're popular among people living in apartments or 
            with limited storage space.

          <h1>Electric Bike</h1>
          <h2>
            Electric bikes come with a built-in motor that 
            provides pedal-assist or full throttle power, making 
            cycling easier, especially on hills or longer 
            distances. E-bikes are becoming increasingly popular 
            among commuters, recreational riders, and even seniors 
            who want to enjoy cycling with less physical exertion. 
            They come in different styles, including road, mountain, 
            and hybrid e-bikes, catering to various riding needs.

          ‚Ä¢In the 1860s, French inventors Pierre Michaux and Pierre Lallement added pedals directly to the front wheel, leading to the invention of the velocipede or "bone-shaker" due to its rough ride on cobblestone streets.

          ‚Ä¢By the 1870s, the penny-farthing or high-wheeler bicycle emerged, with a large front wheel and a small rear wheel. It became popular for speed, but was dangerous due to the high seating position.

          ‚Ä¢The name "penny-farthing" refers to the size difference between the two wheels, similar to the contrast between a large penny and a small farthing coin.

          ‚Ä¢In the 1880s, the safety bicycle was developed, featuring equally sized wheels and a chain drive system that powered the rear wheel. This design, created by John Kemp Starley, is closer to modern bicycles and was much safer than the penny-farthing.
